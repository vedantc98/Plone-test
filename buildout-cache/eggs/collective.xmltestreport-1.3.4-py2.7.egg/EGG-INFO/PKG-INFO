Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an extension to the test runner to the one that ships
        with ``zope.testrunner``, as well as a buildout recipe based on
        ``zc.recipe.testrunner`` to install a test script for this test runner.
        
        The test runner is identical to the one in ``zope.testrunner``, but it is
        capable of writing test reports in the XML format output by JUnit/Ant. This
        allows the test results to be analysed by tools such as the Jenkins continuous
        integration server.

        Usage
        =====
        
        In your buildout, add a part like this::
        
            [buildout]
            parts =
                ...
                test
        
            ...
        
            [test]
            recipe = collective.xmltestreport
            eggs =
                my.package
            defaults = ['--auto-color', '--auto-progress']
        
        The recipe accepts the same options as zc.recipe.testrunner, so look at its
        documentation for details.
        
        When buildout is run, you should have a script in ``bin/test`` and a directory
        ``parts/test``.
        
        To run the tests, use the ``bin/test`` script. If you pass the ``--xml``
        option, test reports will be written to ``parts/test/testreports`` directory::
        
            $ bin/test --xml -s my.package
        
        Use ``bin/test --help`` for a full list of options.
        
        If you are using Jenkins, you can now configure the build to publish JUnit
        test reports for ``<buildoutdir>/parts/test/testreports/*.xml``.

        1.3.4 (2017-02-02)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - Fixed UnicodeDecodeError when error message contains non-ascii.
          Fixes https://github.com/collective/collective.xmltestreport/issues/16

        1.3.3 (2015-09-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Dependency to z3c.recipe.scripts declared but it was nowhere used.
          Removed dependency. This makes it work with newer zc.buildout again.
          Fixes #10
          [jensens]
        
        
        1.3.2 (2015-04-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix error on utf-8 error string.
          [bloodbare]
        
        - Fix encoding problem in python 3.
          [cedricmessiant]
        
        
        1.3.1 (2013-10-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Make sure errors in layer teardown don't prevent the test report from
          getting written.

        1.3.0 (2013-04-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Revert "Exclude system site-packages from tests' sys.path". This commit
          changed the API/output of collective.xmltestreport in a minor version without
          mentioning. This essentially broke all Jenkins jobs out there including all
          Plone coredev jobs and all the packages/code that relies on that output.

        1.2.8 (2012-08-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Add missing dependency to z3c.recipe.scripts
          [ggozad]
        
        
        1.2.7 (2012-08-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Exclude system site-packages from tests' sys.path'
          [Andrey Lebedev]
        
        
        1.2.6 (2012-06-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix import errors problem (TypeError) introduced in 1.2.5.
          [jone]
        
        
        1.2.5 (2012-06-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Handle startup failures (import errors) and expose them in the testresults.
          [jone]
        
        
        1.2.4 (2011-12-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix brown-bag release 1.2.3 that was missing CHANGES.txt etc.
        
        
        1.2.3 (2011-12-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Only depend on `elementtree` for Python < 2.5.
        
        
        1.2.2 (2011-05-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed ``OSError`` in formatter which could occur when a test case modifies
          the current working directory to a directory that gets removed during the
          test. In such cases we fall back to the working directory as it was in the
          beginning of the tests.
          [dokai]
        
        
        1.2.1 (2011-02-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed ``IndexError`` in formatter which could occur when the path of the
          current working directory was part of the path + file name of the doctest
          file but shorter.
        
        
        1.2 (2011-01-27)
        ----------------
        
        - Added support for Manuel_ tests. It gets activated when the package under
          test has tests using `manuel` and this way depends on `manuel`.

        1.1 (2011-01-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Require `zope.testrunner` and remove support for zope.testing 3.7.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added support for `zope.testrunner` while retaining support for the older
          `zope.testing.testrunner`.
          [hannosch]
        
        - No longer use the deprecated `zope.testing.doctest`.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Distribution metadata cleanup.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use built-in `xml.etree` in favor of `elementree` in Python 2.5+ and added
          missing dependency on `zc.recipe.egg`.

        1.0b3 (2010-06-07)
        ------------------
        
        * Rename the ``-x`` option ``--xml``. This is necessary by zope.testing now
          uses the ``-x`` option for something else. :-(
        
        1.0b2 (2009-11-08)
        ------------------
        
        * Maintain compatibility with zope.testing 3.7.
        
        1.0b1 (2009-11-07)
        ------------------
        
        * Initial release
