        Products.DateRecurringIndex
        ===========================
        
        A Zope 2 catalog index with support for indexing of recurring events, following
        the icalendar standard. It is a drop-in replacement for the Zope2 DateIndex and
        will produce the same results for non-recurring dates.
        
        The DateRecurringIndex accepts following parameters:
        
        id
            Required. The name of the field or object attribute to be indexed.
        
        recurdef
            Required. The name of the object attribute, which returns the icalendar
            rrule (recurrence rule) string.
        
        until
            Optional. The name of the objects attribute, which returns the date, until
            the recurrence should happen. The recurrence definition can also contain an
            UNTIL component. If both are defined, the recurrence calculation stops 
            whenever the first until-date is met. If not given at all, there is a
            MAXCOUNT ceiling constant, defined in plone.event.recurrence, which defines
            the maximum number of occurences.
        
        
        Datetime.DateTime vs. datetime.datetime
        =======================================
        
        Inside Zope2 everybody uses DateTime.DateTime or iow the Zope-DateTime. At time
        of writing Zope-DateTime (around 1998) there was no good date/time
        implementation in python. But these days  we have a better implementation.
        Even if the pythons datetime implementation has its problems, together with pytz
        for timezone handling it is very mature.
        
        So, why is it covered here? Just because dst-handling over recurring events works
        only if the start and until values are non-naive python datetimes. Just keep it
        in mind when using this index: If you use recurring dates and you want
        dst-adjust make sure your implementation returns a python datetime. And also
        keep in mind: If youre i.e. in Austria with CET timezone, add a recurring date:
        it will look fine to you, every day at 11:00am, doesnt matter if DST or not,
        your event happens. If you go international and your event is shown in a
        different timezone - or in the same in a country without DST at all - it might
        differ and is not always at the the time.

          https://github.com/collective/Products.DateRecurringIndex/issues/1
          For proper sorting, existing installations may wish to reindex any
          indexes installed in their catalog using DateRecurringIndex.
