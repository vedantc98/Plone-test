Introduction
============

``plone.app.caching`` provides a Plone UI and default rules for managing HTTP response caching in Plone.
It builds on ``z3c.caching``, ``plone.caching`` and ``plone.cachepurging``.

``plone.app.caching`` requires Plone 4 or later.

Installation
============

Plone >=4.1
-----------

**From Plone 4.1 onwards, ``plone.app.caching`` is shipped as a dependency of Plone core.**

It is available from the Control Panel, but **not enabled by default**.
You can enable it from the "add-ons" menu option.

Plone 4.0
---------

Add ``plone.app.caching`` to the ``eggs`` list in your ``buildout.cfg``, or as a dependency of one of your own packages in ``setup.py``.
ZCML configuration will be automatically loaded via a ``z3c.autoinclude`` entry point.
You will also need to install the package in Plone's Add-ons control panel as normal.

This package depends on a number of other packages, including ``z3c.form`` and ``plone.app.registry``, that do not ship with Plone 4.0.
You will probably want to lock down the versions for those packages using a known good set.
Add this to the the ``extends`` line in your ``buildout.cfg``, *after* the line that includes the Plone KGS::

    extends =
        ...
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.caching/1.0a1

Update the version number at the end of the URL as appropriate.
You can find here an `overview of the versions <http://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.caching>`_

  [timo]

  an edge case since this would ordinarily be handled by moderate caching.
  [smcmahon]

- Add some testing for weak caching operations.
  [smcmahon]

  is missing.
  [davisagli]

- Fix bug `12038 <http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12038>`_. If transformIterable

  [ebrehault]


1.1.1 (2012-08-30)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.1 (2012-05-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use zope.browserresource instead of zope.app.publisher.
  [hannosch]

- Deprecated methods aliases were replaced on tests.
  [hvelarde]


1.0.4 (unreleased)
------------------

- Fix possible test failures by logging in with the user name.
  Note that user id and user name (login name) can differ.
  [maurits]


1.0.3 (2012-04-15)
------------------

- Fix packaging issue.
  [esteele]


1.0.2 (2012-04-15)
------------------
- Handle caching of resource registries in RAM cache by not storing empty
  bodies in the RAMCache
  [eleddy with major tseaver support]


1.0.1 (2012-01-26)
------------------
- Properly handle a changed configuration from with etags to no etags by
  forcing a page refresh
  [eleddy]

- When not caching with etags, don't sent an etag header to stop caching
  [eleddy]

- When there was an error like Unauthorized, 200 status and empty body would be
  cached in RAMCache instead of not caching anything.
  This is due to a bug with Zope 2.13 publication events :
  response.status is not set when IPubBeforeAbort is notified.
  Fixed by using error_status stored on request by plone.transformchain.
  [gotcha]

- Added 12 translation strings for ruleset's title and description. Corresponding translation
  strings have been added in plone.app.caching-manual.pot in PloneTranslations
  [giacomos]

- Added 6 translation strings for caching profiles' title and description. Corresponding translation
  strings have been added in plone.app.caching-manual.pot in PloneTranslations
  [giacomos]

- Changed wrong i18n domain in the messagefactory. plone.caching -> plone.app.caching.
  [giacomos]

1.0 - 2011-05-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use the `userLanguage` ETag component in place of the language ETag component
  in the default configs to allow ETags to be used for anonymous users with
  caching.
  [elro]

- Add the SERVER_URL to the RAM cache key.
  [elro]

- Declare `plone.namedfile.scaling.ImageScale` to be a `plone.stableResource`.
  [elro]

- Add MANIFEST.in.
  [WouterVH]

- Fixed tests failing on Zope 2.13 due to the HTTP status no longer being
  included in the response headers.
  [davisagli]

- Add an ILastModified adapter for FSPageTemplate as the FSObject adapter
  would otherwise take precedence.
  [stefan]


1.0b2 - 2011-02-10
------------------

- Added `News Item` to the list of `purgedContentTypes`, so the image field
  and its scales gets purged.
  [stefan, hannosch]

- Associated `file_view`, `image_view` and `image_view_fullscreen` by default
  with the `plone.content.itemView` ruleset, since none of them is the default
  view of their respective content type, they didn't get the automated
  handling.
  [stefan, hannosch]

- Added purging for plone.app.blob's BlobFields.
  [stefan, hannosch]

- Fix documentation to refer to the correct `resourceRegistries` instead of
  the singular version.
  [stefan, hannosch]

- Use plone.registry ``FieldRefs`` to manage parameter overrides. This
  requires plone.app.registry 1.0b3 and plone.app.registry 1.0b3 or later.
  [optilude]

- Update distribution metadata to current best practice.
  [hannosch]

- Added an etag component to track the existence of a copy/cut cookie
  [newbery]

- Fixed various i18n issues.
  [vincentfretin]

  This is a simple way to switch off caching for logged-in users. See
  the README for more details.
  [optilude]

- Add basic plone.namedfile caching rules, if plone.namedfile is installed
  [optilude]

- Implement lookup based on portal type class/interface as well as name,
  and set up defaults for items and folders.
  [optilude]

------------------

- Initial release.
  [optilude, newbery, smcmahon]
