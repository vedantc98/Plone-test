Description: Welcome to Plone batching's documentation!
        ==========================================
        
        This package includes facilities for creating a batched sequence.
        
        It originated from the the PloneBatch module written for Plone which in
        itself has been based on Zope2's ZTUtils.Batch.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.1.2 (2017-07-20)
        ------------------
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Added missing Zope2 dependency.  [davisagli]
        
        
        1.1.1 (2016-08-12)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - Use zope.interface decorator.
          [gforcada]
        
        
        1.1.0 (2016-02-12)
        ------------------
        
        .. warning:: Upgrade Warning!
            If you customized the batchnavigation.pt file or use specific CSS styles for it, you might have to update them to reflect the new HTML structure.
        
        New:
        
        - Refactor batchnavigation HTML layout to use nav/ul/li elements instead of div/span.
          [davilima6]
        
        - Switches deprecated ``listingBar`` CSS class to ``pagination``.
          [davilima6]
        
        - Make ellipses stylable and provide more CSS hooks to pagination markup.
          [davilima6]
        
        
        1.0.8 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        New:
        
        - Make ellipses stylable and provide more CSS hooks to pagination markup. This also deprecates the CSS class ``listingBar`` in favor of more commonly used ``pagination``, which will be the canonical one in Plone 5.0.2 and up.
          [davilima6]
        
        
        1.0.7 (2016-01-08)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - Fixed missing test in released package.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.0.6 (2016-01-08)
        ------------------
        
        New:
        
        - Introduce a "omit_params" option for the ``make_link`` method and filter out
          ``ajax_load`` by default. When loading the contents with batchnavigation via
          ajax, it doesn't render the links with ajax_load enabled, which would
          probably lead to usability troubles.
          [thet]
        
        Fixes:
        
        - PEP 8, UTF 8 headers, docs cleanup.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.0.5 (2015-07-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Make sure pagenumber value is not bigger that numpages
          or it fails in previous_pages when using orphan
          [gbastien]
        
        - Allow orphan size to be equal to batch size. This allows
          the edge case of batch size 0 with default orphan size 0.

          https://dev.plone.org/ticket/13880\
          [thepjot]
        
        - Fix multiple_pages if the length of the sequence is exactly the
          page length.
          [gaudenz]
        
        1.0.1 (2014-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix issue with sequences when the reported length was different
          than len() iteration would return the full unbatched sequence.
          [alecm]
        
        
        1.0 (2013-05-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Use index instead of template attribute in BatchView to be able to customize
          only the template.
          [vincentfretin, thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Fixed wrong msgid for 'First item'.
          [vincentfretin]

        Usage
        =====
        
        A batch defined in plone.batching usually consists of two things:
        
         1. A batch object.
            This is usually a wrapper for a sequence, which provides slices of information.
        
         #. A batch view.
            This is needed for display.
            It contains links to navigate to the slices defined in 1.
        
        Both elements can be defined and accessed in Python code AND pagetemplates.
        
        Batch navigation in templates
        -----------------------------
        
        For the use of batching features in Page Templates *plone.batching* the first thing you have to do is to create a sequence batch and put it in a template variable named *batch*.
        You should do this in a view class if possible::
        
          <div tal:define="batch view/batchresults;">
        
        or you can do it in the template itself if necessary::
        
          <div tal:define="Batch python:modules['plone.batching'].Batch;
                           b_size python:30;b_start python:0;b_start request/b_start | b_start;
                           batch python:Batch(results, b_size, int(b_start), orphan=1);">
        
        For the navigation you add the following snippet to your template::
        
         <tal:batchnavigation
             define="batchnavigation nocall:context/@@batchnavigation"
             replace="structure python:batchnavigation(batch)" />
        
        For backwards compatibility *plone.batching* provides a drop in metal macro *navigation* in the *batch_macros* template.
        Add it to the template like this::
        
         <div metal:use-macro="context/batch_macros/macros/navigation" />
        
        
        Usage in Python code
        --------------------
        
        A batch is instantiated like this::
        
          >>> from plone.batching import Batch
          >>> batch = Batch(range(100), size=15, orphan=10)
        
        This generates 5 subbatches with 15 items from the sequence [0, 1, ..., 99] and one subbatch with the last 25 items (including 10 orphaned items).
        For a detailed description of available parameters for a batch look at the API of the BaseBatch class.
        
        Another way to instaniate a batch is like this::
        
          >>> batch = Batch.fromPagenumber(range(100), pagesize=15, pagenumber=1)
        
        This results in 6 batches with 15 items and one batch with the last 10 items.
        This way of creating a batch is meant as a short cut and does not support all the options the canonical constructor supports.
        
        For big sequences there is another base class provided by the package: *QuantumBatch*.
        This batch generates quantum leaps for quicker navigation.
        
        ::
        
          >>> from plone.batching.batch import QuantumBatch
          >>> qb = QuantumBatch(range(1000), 10, start=500, quantumleap=1)
          >>> qb.leapforward
          [69, 84]
          >>> qb.leapback
          [18, 33]
        
        It is possible to navigate the batch stored in the two attributes *leapback* and *leapforward* with 5 clicks.
        
        Usage in Views
        --------------
        
        Plone.batching comes with a customizable batch View *batchnavigation* with the view class *BatchView*.
        The view comes with a template.
        All you have to do, if you want to customize it, is to override the make_link-method.
        This method should return a string with the link to the given *pagenumber*.
        Here is an example from the folder_contents implementation in plone.app.content::
        
          >>> from plone.batching.browser import BatchView
          >>> from ZTUtils import make_query
        
          >>> class MyBatchView(BatchView):
          ...     def make_link(self, pagenumber):
          ...         batchlinkparams = self.request.form.copy()
          ...         return '%s?%s' % (self.request.ACTUAL_URL,
          ...                 make_query(batchlinkparams, {'pagenumber': pagenumber}))
        
        One thing you have to keep in mind is to call the batch view with a batch as the first argument.
        
        ::
        
          >>> from Products.Five import BrowserView
          >>> class MyContentView(BrowserView):
          ...     def batch(self):
          ...         " "  # see above how a batch is defined
          ...
          ...     def batching(self):
          ...         return MyBatchView(self.context, self.request)(self.batch)
        
        Now you can use this in the template of your view.
        
        ::
        
           <div tal:replace="structure view/batching" />
